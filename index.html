  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <p>I am currently working on a project using HTML to design a website and have done so for my former high school to create a website for clubs at the school.</p>

  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <p>I've taken a crash course in Python and have a good working understanding of the language. I wanted to learn a language and had head how beginner friendly it was.

    I've created games in Godot 4 and am able to create small games with the engine. I did so for a game-making class I took. 
    
    In my free time, I like to code in CPP as it is my preferred language and I have 2 years of experience with it. I started using it with my first computer science class and have liked it ever since.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>I often make small projects like calculators to help me understand concepts in my math and physics classes. Nothing noteworthy but I want to start working on a few things once I get settled in Bend.</p>
